      <h3>Competition Rules</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>All races will be Mario Kart Double Dash, 150cc, no mirror mode.</li>
	<li>Items will be set to Recommended.</li>
	<li>In each round of the tournament, the remaining participants will be
	  divided into groups of 3 and 4. Each group will play one cup of races, which will be
	  determined ahead of time by the tournament host.</li>
	<li>The top 2 racers from each group will advance to the next round.</li>
	<li>The top 2 will be determined by the following point system. After each race,
	  each racer will be awarded points equal to his or her placing in that race. For example,
	  the 1st place racer gets 1 point, 2nd place gets 2 points, and so on and so forth.</li>
	<li>The 2 racers with the lowest point totals after all 4 races are complete will advance to
	  the next round. In the event of a tie, a tiebreaking race will be held between the
	  tied racers on a course chosen by the tournament director.
	</li>
	<li>Point keeping cards will be used by the tournament director to keep track of points accumulated after each race.</li>
	<li>Once each group finishes their races, the remaining players will be re-divided into new groups of 3 and 4.</li>
	<li>This process repeats itself until only 4 racers remain. Then these racers will play through the Special Cup once.
	  The champion and runner-up of the tournament will be decided by each racer's point total after these 4 races.</li>
	<li>Additional battle mode tournaments will be held following the main event depending on demand.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Administrative Rules</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Player may use their own Gamecube controllers.</li>
	<li>Player slot number will be determined by drawing straws. Character selection for each player's first character will go in order according to player slot number.</li>
	<li>Once each player has chosen a character, selection for the second character will be done in reverse order (so the 
	  player who chose last now gets to choose his or her second character first).</li>
	<li>If a player is absent when his or her group is scheduled to play, the next group will be scheduled instead. If all other groups have
	  already played, and that player fails to appear after 5 minutes, he or she will be disqualified.</li>
	<li>Intentionally disrupting the game by pausing, distracting other players, etc, will result in a warning, followed by
	  disqualification upon second offense.</li>
	<li>If the size of a group falls below 3 because of disqualifications, then the remaining players in the group will
	  automatically advance.</li>
	</ul>
