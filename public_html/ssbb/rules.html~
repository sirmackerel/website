The KCECH Smash Brothers Tourney will be held on Saturday, November 6th @ 7PM in the 1938 Lounge (click <a href="directions.html">here</a> for directions). 
There will be both a Super Smash Brothers Brawl singles tournament and a doubles tournament. 
<br><br>The following are the rules we will use for both the singles and doubles tournaments:
<ul>
<li>All matches will be played best out of 3 games, with 3 stocks and an 8 minute time limit</li>
<li>The championship match will be played best out of 5 games instead of 3</li>
<li>All items turned off</li>
<li>Gentleman's rule for stage selection: If both parties can agree on a stage, then that stage will be played. If the two parties cannot come to an agreement in a timely fashion, then a random stage will be chosen from the following list:
  <ul>
    <li>Battlefield</li>
    <li>Yoshi's Island</li>
    <li>Smashville</li>
    <li>Final Destination</li>
    <li>Castle Siege</li>
    <li>Pokemon Stadium (Melee)</li>
    <li>Lylat Cruise</li>
  </ul>
<li>The loser of a game may decide to either a) use the Gentleman's rule for stage selection or b) pick any of the stages from the above list or from one of the following counterpick stages for the next game in the best out of 3 series:
  <ul>
    <li>Frigate Orpheon</li>
    <li>Brinstar</li>
    <li>Pictochat</li>
    <li>Rainbow Cruise</li>
    <li>Pokemon Stadium 2</li>
    <li>Jungle Japes</li>
    <li>Delfino Plaza</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Either party may request a double-blind pick before the first game of a match. For the double-blind pick, each party will write down on a slip of paper the character they will pick in advance (without knowledge of the opposing party's character choice) and hand these slips of paper to the tournament organizer.</li>
<li>Any party may choose a different character throughout the tournament and in-between games. However, during a best of 3 (or best of 5) match, the loser of the previous game may opt to select a character after the winner of the previous game makes a character selection.</li>
<li>Extending Meta Knight's Dimensional Cape is banned (If you are wondering what this is, check <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdmwKfPchms">this out </a>)
<li>Stalling is banned (i.e. using chain grabs against a wall beyond 300%, using Sonic's Neutral B repeatedly underneath a stage, gliding back and forth repeatedly under a stage)</li>
<li>Purposefully freezing an opponent is banned.</li>
<li>All standing-infinite chain grabs (including King Dedede's small-step chain grab) and infinite grab-releases are banned (if King Dedede chain grabs, he must dash between each grab for it to be legal).</li>
<li>Planking is banned. To enforce this, no player may grab the ledge more than 50 times in a match. Doing so will result in disqualification.
<li>Doing a banned action or doing anything that prevents the match from completing will result in a warning or restarting the match, followed by disqualification upon a second offense.</li>
<li>If there is a controller malfunction detected during the match, the match will be restarted.</li>
<li>If a party is not present for a match, then other matches will be scheduled (when possible). However, if no other matches in that round of the tournament are left to be scheduled and 5 minutes pass, then the missing party will be disqualified.</li>
<li>All parties may bring their own controllers to use for the match.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Additional rules for the doubles tournament are below:
<ul>
<li>Single elimination, best out of 3 matches, 3 stocks per combatant, 10 minute time limit
<li>Friendly fire will be turned off</li>
<li>Stock sharing is allowed (i.e. if one party member dies first, he or she is allowed to take stocks from the surviving party member when possible)</li>
<li>If one member of a team is absent, then the same late-disqualification rule applies unless the present team member is willing to accept another player as a substitute team member. However, once this substitution has been made, that team must remain together for the remainder of their time in the tournament. The absent team member is then removed from the doubles tournament and cannot re-enter under any circumstances. The substitute team member cannot be a member of any other doubles team in the tournament unless his or her team mate is also absent. In this case, the same rule applies to the absent member of the other team, and the placement of the newly formed team in the bracket will be decided by a coin flip.</li>
<li>As an absolute last resort, if one team member is absent and no substitute can be found, then the remaining team member may opt to play alone to avoid disqualification. All of the rules for a normal doubles match will remain in effect.
